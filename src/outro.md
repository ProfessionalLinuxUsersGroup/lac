# Outro

Wow — you made it to the end of the course! That’s a lot of information to cover, so take a moment to congratulate yourself. We hope you took good notes, because you’ll be coming back to them in the future. Keep a link to this book as well — it’s always here as a handy reference.  

By now, you should have a deeper understanding of core Linux functionality and how to manage it. You also have a clearer picture of the administrator’s role in relation to broader operational duties.  

We hope you had fun and maybe even made some friends along the way. More importantly, we hope this course has inspired you to continue your studies and get involved in other ProLUG courses.  

If you are participating in the group course, remember that you still have a final assignment to complete.  

Finally, we’d greatly appreciate it if you helped spread the word by sharing your experience with others and letting them know how they can get involved. A good starting point is [ProLUG.org](https://prolug.org).
