Unit 14 Discussion Post 1: Refer to your Unit 5 scan of the systems. 

You know that Ansible is a tool that you want to maintain in the environment. Review this online documentation: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html

1. Make an inventory of the servers, grouped any way you like.
2. What format did you choose to use for your inventory?
3. What other things might you include later in your inventory to make it more useful?
