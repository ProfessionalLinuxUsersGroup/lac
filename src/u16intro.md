    </p>
</div>

## Overview

---

This unit introduces Incident Response, a critical discipline in cybersecurity and systems administration focused on identifying,
containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from system incidents. This unit also demonstrates the crucial need for
policies and procedures in the likely event an incident occurs which facilitate successful remedies for administrators during
stressful events.

By the end of this unit, you'll understand the key phases and practices for developing and executing an effective incident
response plan within enterprise environments to minimize the impact of system incidences.

## Learning Objectives

---

**By the end of this unit, you should be able to:**

- Define the stages of the incident response lifecycle.
- Understand the roles and responsibilities within an incident response team.
- Outline steps for initial incident detection and triage.
- Describe methods for system recovery and post-incident analysis.

## Relevance & Context

---

Incident response is paramount as it directly impacts an organization's ability to minimize the damage and financial costs associated
with events like misconfigurations, bugs, security breaches or vulnerabilities, and more by enabling rapid action.

An effective incident response plan also ensures business continuity, allowing systems and data to be restored efficiently and maintaining
critical operations. Furthermore, robust incident response demonstrates adherence to regulatory compliance and builds trust with customers and stakeholders.
