        <h1>Unit 7 - Package Management & Patching</h1>
    </p>
</div>

## Overview

---

Managing software on a Linux system involves two essential practices: package management and patching. Together, they ensure that systems remain functional, up-to-date, and secure by handling software installation, updates, and vulnerability remediation. 

- **Package Management:** the system used to install, upgrade, configure, and remove software packages while automatically resolving dependencies and maintaining system consistency.

- **Patching:** the process of applying updates to software packages or the kernel to fix bugs, close security vulnerabilities, or improve performance.

## Learning Objectives

---

1. **Become Familiar with Package Management:**

- In this unit you will see what comprises a RPM, YUM, and RPM package and how professional administrators carefully choose what is installed on a system.

2. **Become Familiar with Patching:**

- Learn about general patching cycles.
- Understand why it matters to inpsect packages and associated dependancies.
- Get hands on with inspecting packages.

## Relevance & Context

---

The skills taught in this unit are indispensable for several reasons:

- **Efficient System Management:**  
  The RHEL environment is typically managed via the command line. Proficiency in the CLI, along with an in-depth understanding of the file system, is crucial for daily tasks like system configuration, package management (using tools such as YUM or DNF), and remote troubleshooting.

- **Security and Stability:**  
  Editing configuration files, managing system services, and monitoring logs are all critical tasks that ensure the secure and stable operation of RHEL systems. A robust understanding of these basics is necessary to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with enterprise security standards.

- **Professional Certification & Career Growth:**  
  For those pursuing certifications like the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) or Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE), these foundational skills are not only testable requirements but also a stepping stone for more advanced topics such as automation (using Ansible), container management (with Podman or OpenShift), and performance tuning.

- **Operational Excellence:**  
  In enterprise settings where uptime and rapid incident response are paramount, having a solid grasp of these fundamentals enables administrators to quickly diagnose issues, apply fixes, and optimize system performanceâ€”thereby directly impacting business continuity and service quality.
